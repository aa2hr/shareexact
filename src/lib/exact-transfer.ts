/**
 * The money path, executed against the user's wallet.
 *
 * Everything here reads through the wallet's own provider rather than the app
 * server, for one reason: the numbers a user signs must come from the same node
 * that will execute the transaction. A quote assembled server-side and shipped
 * to the browser is a quote that can already be wrong by the time it is signed.
 *
 * Two routes are supported:
 *
 *   guarded   — `ExactTransfer.transferShares(...)` re-reads the multiplier
 *               inside the transaction itself and reverts if a corporate action
 *               is about to land. Requires an approval and the deployed address
 *               in `VITE_EXACT_TRANSFER`. This is exact-share settlement.
 *   preflight — a plain `transfer(address,uint256)` of a raw amount computed
 *               from a multiplier read moments earlier. No approval, no extra
 *               contract, works today against any Stock Token. This is NOT
 *               exact-share settlement, and neither the API nor the UI calls it
 *               that: the multiplier can move between the read and the block.
 *
 * The preflight route narrows the race window to seconds. The guarded route
 * closes it. The UI names which one it used, in those words.
