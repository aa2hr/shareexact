/**
 * The off-chain twin of `ShareExactGuard.sol`.
 *
 * The precedence order below is identical to `_evaluate()` in the contract and
 * is enforced by `market-state.test.ts`. If the two ever drift, an integrator
 * reading the UI and an integrator reading the chain would disagree about
 * whether a price can be trusted, which is the exact failure this product
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * Two separate ideas live here and are deliberately not merged:
 *
 *   DataState    — can this price be trusted right now. Derived only from what
 *                  a contract can observe: sequencer, feed age, pause flag,
 *                  pending multiplier.
 *   SessionKind  — what humans call this time of day. Derived from the NYSE
 *                  calendar, which no contract can know.
 *
 * A weekend is not a failure. It is a normal, expected STALE window, and the
 * product's job is to say so out loud instead of showing a Friday price as if
 * it were live.
