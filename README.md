**The call every Robinhood Chain protocol should make before it moves money against a Stock Token.**

**Concretely:** on a token with a 4x multiplier, someone moving $10,000 of
stock — 25 shares at $400 — computes 25 raw units the obvious way and sends
100 shares, $40,000, a $30,000 overshoot. The ERC-20 transfer succeeds. No
revert, no warning, no way to tell from the receipt.

A Robinhood Stock Token is a plain ERC-20 whose raw unit is not a share. One raw
unit is `uiMultiplier() / 1e18` underlying shares, and that ratio moves every
time a dividend is reinvested or the underlying splits. Meanwhile the Chainlink
feed that prices it publishes 24/5, while the token itself trades 24/7.

So there are two silent failure modes sitting under every product on this chain:

1. **Unit drift.** Anything that quotes shares — a lending market, a basket, a
   portfolio screen — has to convert to raw units itself, and each one invents
   its own rounding and its own corporate-action race.
2. **Confident staleness.** For roughly two thirds of every week the feed is
   holding a value from the last time the cash market was open. An integration
   that does not check `updatedAt` renders a Friday price as if it were live,
   and a risk engine built on that will happily compute a health factor from it.

ShareExact is the layer that makes both of those explicit: a contract, an SDK,
and a desk that refuses to show a number it cannot source.

Both contracts are verified on Sourcify. The proof transaction moved 0.002
shares through the guarded route: 0.001998450882483378 raw units at a multiplier
of 1.000775159164630595, with a 1 wei rounding shortfall consented to on-chain
and recorded in the `ExactShareTransfer` event.

None of that has to be taken on trust:

```bash
npm run deploy:verify    # 16 checks against live chain state
npm run feeds:parity     # does the desk agree with the guard about every feed
```

### `ShareExactGuard.sol`

A read-only, custody-free state machine. Given a token it answers one question:
can this price be trusted right now, and why not.

```solidity
enum DataState { FRESH, STALE, ORACLE_PAUSED, CORP_ACTION, SEQUENCER_DOWN, NO_FEED }
```

The enum is about **data**, not about the NYSE calendar. A contract cannot know
it is Saturday. It can know the feed stopped updating, the sequencer is down,
the issuer paused the oracle, or a multiplier change is imminent — and that is
all this contract claims to know. Session labelling lives off-chain.

Design constraints it holds to:

- **Observation never reverts; conversion fails closed.** `state()` and
  `priceOf()` degrade to an explicit state on any third-party failure. But if the
  multiplier cannot be read, `sharesToRaw`, `rawToShares` and a transfer all
  revert rather than guess (`usdValue` does not, because a feed prices one raw
  token and never needs the multiplier) — an unreadable ratio is not evidence of a 1:1 token,
  and guessing wrong moves the wrong amount of money. See `docs/SECURITY.md`.
- Staleness outranks the advisory `oraclePaused()` flag, because Robinhood
  documents that flag as not enforced on-chain.
- No custody, no upgradeability, no admin function that can move a token. The
  worst case for an integrator is a wrong answer, never a stolen balance.

### `ExactTransfer.sol`

Moves an exact number of **shares** rather than an exact number of raw units.
The multiplier is read inside the transaction, so a quote built minutes ago in a
browser cannot settle against a ratio that has since changed. Rounding is floor
and the caller states the shortfall it accepts, so truncation cannot pass
unnoticed.

One deliberate asymmetry, and it is the detail worth arguing about in a review:
**a transfer does not need a fresh price, only an intact multiplier.** So a
weekend (`STALE`) transfer is allowed, and a transfer quoted seconds before a
split (`CORP_ACTION`) is not.

## Run it

Node 22.12 or newer is required: the unit tests execute TypeScript directly
through `--experimental-strip-types`. `npm test` checks this first and says so
rather than failing with a syntax error.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev                 # desk on :8080
npm test                    # TypeScript unit tests + Solidity tests
npm run typecheck
```

Contracts on their own:

```bash
cd contracts
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts   # first time only
forge test -vv
```

### Prices

The live Guard on 4663 has eight Chainlink feeds registered (AAPL, GOOGL, INTC,
MSFT, NVDA, SLV, SPY, TSLA). `npm run deploy:verify` and `npm run feeds:parity`
check that the desk and the guard agree about those eight.

A fresh local clone without `ROBINHOOD_FEEDS` still labels unknown names as
indicative / `NO_FEED`. That is intentional: the remaining symbols in
`src/lib/feeds.generated.json` are shown by the desk and are not registered on
the guard. Registering one is a single transaction. To point a local desk at a
feed map:

```bash
FEED_DIRECTORY_URL=<chainlink feed directory for chain 4663> npm run feeds:sync
# or
export ROBINHOOD_FEEDS='{"NVDA":{"feed":"0x…","maxStaleness":93600,"decimals":8}}'
```

Feed addresses are never hardcoded in source. Robinhood's docs point at
Chainlink's published list as the source of truth, and a pinned address is
indistinguishable from a dead market the first time a feed is migrated.

### Environment

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ROBINHOOD_RPC_URL` | Dedicated RPC. Falls back to the public endpoint, which is a demo path only |
| `ROBINHOOD_FEEDS` | JSON feed map, highest priority |
| `ROBINHOOD_SEQUENCER_FEED` | Chainlink L2 uptime feed. Empty disables the check |
| `ROBINHOOD_SEQUENCER_GRACE` | Seconds after the sequencer recovers before data is trusted. Default 1800 |
| `ROBINHOOD_CORP_ACTION_WINDOW` | Seconds before a multiplier change to warn. Default 7200 |
| `VITE_EXACT_TRANSFER` | Deployed ExactTransfer address from `deployments/chain-4663.json`. Unset uses the direct-transfer route |

## What is real and what is not

Being precise about this is the whole point of the project, so it applies to the
project's own claims too.

**Real, reading live from chain 4663:**
token registry from Robinhood's `/rhj/assets`, balances via batched `balanceOf`,
`uiMultiplier()` / `newUIMultiplier()` / `effectiveAt()` / `oraclePaused()` read
from each token, Chainlink `latestRoundData()` for the eight registered feeds,
sequencer uptime, and signed ERC-20 transfers computed from the live multiplier.

This is the transaction shown in the technical demo.

Blockscout reports the raw ERC-20 amount because explorers do not read
`uiMultiplier`. That disagreement is the product.

**Real on the eight registered names; indicative on the rest:** a name the Guard
does not have a feed for reports `NO_FEED` and the desk labels the mark as
indicative. It does not present a demo number as a live one.

**Simulation, and labelled as such in the UI:** the stress scenarios, the
volatility and LTV tables, and the hypothetical credit line in the risk view.
These are demo heuristics for showing the shape of the problem. They are not
credit parameters and nothing in this repo is a lending market.
