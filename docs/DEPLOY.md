# Deploy runbook

Target: `ShareExactGuard` and `ExactTransfer` live and verified on chain 4663,
addresses recorded in the repository, the desk switched from **preflight** to
**guarded** settlement, and at least one Chainlink feed registered so prices
stop reading "indicative".

Budget about 40 minutes the first time. Do the testnet pass first — it costs
nothing and catches every mistake that matters.

---

## 0. Before you start

You need three things and none of them are code:

**A deployer key.** Generate a fresh one for this. Do not use a wallet that
holds anything.

```bash
cast wallet new
```

Store it outside the repository — `D:\Docker\shareexact\secrets\` or
equivalent. The root `.gitignore` covers `.env` and `*.key`, but the safest key
is one that was never in a project directory at all: a repository that has ever
contained a private key is compromised whether or not the commit was pushed.

**Gas.** ETH is the gas token on both networks.

- Testnet (46630): free, from `https://faucet.testnet.chain.robinhood.com`.
  Robinhood's own support pages point there. QuickNode also runs one at
  `https://faucet.quicknode.com/robinhood/testnet` if the first is empty.
- Mainnet (4663): bridge a small amount through the canonical bridge.
  Deployment plus feed registration is well under 0.01 ETH. Bridging in is
  immediate; bridging back out is the 7-day optimistic window, so send only what
  you are willing to leave there.

Explorers: `https://robinhoodchain.blockscout.com` for mainnet,
`https://explorer.testnet.chain.robinhood.com` for testnet.

**The Chainlink feed addresses.** From Chainlink's published directory for this
chain. Do not copy them from a blog post, and do not let the sync script guess:
`symbolFromPair` uses a regular expression and a wrong ticker means a token
priced by the wrong asset, which is the single worst failure this whole
repository is built to prevent.

---

## 1. Testnet first (chain 46630)

```bash
cd contracts
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v5.1.0
forge build
forge test -vv            # 65 tests must be green before anything leaves your machine

export PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
export GUARD_OWNER=$(cast wallet address --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY)
export CORP_ACTION_WINDOW=7200

forge script script/Deploy.s.sol \
  --rpc-url robinhood_testnet \
  --broadcast
```

Then, from the repository root:

```bash
node scripts/record-deployment.mjs --chain 46630
node scripts/verify-deployment.mjs --chain 46630
```

The verifier reads the live chain and checks things `forge test` cannot: that
the address holds bytecode, that `ExactTransfer.guard()` points at the guard you
actually deployed, that the owner is not the zero address, and that an
unregistered token answers `NO_FEED` with a zero multiplier rather than
reverting or claiming 1.0.

If that passes, repeat on mainnet. If it does not, fix it here where it is free.

---

## 2. Mainnet (chain 4663)

```bash
cd contracts
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
export GUARD_OWNER=0x...              # see the ownership note below
export CORP_ACTION_WINDOW=7200
export SEQUENCER_FEED=0x...           # Chainlink L2 uptime feed, or omit
export SEQUENCER_GRACE=1800

forge script script/Deploy.s.sol \
  --rpc-url robinhood \
  --broadcast \
  --verify \
  --verifier blockscout \
  --verifier-url https://robinhoodchain.blockscout.com/api
```

If `--verify` fails during the broadcast — it often does on a young explorer —
deploy anyway and verify afterwards:

```bash
forge verify-contract <GUARD_ADDRESS> src/ShareExactGuard.sol:ShareExactGuard \
  --chain 4663 --verifier blockscout \
  --verifier-url https://robinhoodchain.blockscout.com/api \
  --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode "constructor(address,uint64)" $GUARD_OWNER 7200)

forge verify-contract <EXACT_TRANSFER_ADDRESS> src/ExactTransfer.sol:ExactTransfer \
  --chain 4663 --verifier blockscout \
  --verifier-url https://robinhoodchain.blockscout.com/api \
  --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode "constructor(address)" <GUARD_ADDRESS>)
```

Record and verify:

```bash
npm run deploy:record
npm run deploy:verify
```

Then open both explorer links from `deployments/chain-4663.json`, confirm the
source tab shows verified code, and flip `"verified": true` in the JSON. That
field is a claim about something a reviewer can check in one click, so it should
never be true before the click works.

### Ownership

For the hackathon the deploying EOA as owner is defensible and the verifier
prints a note when it sees one. Before anyone lends against this, move it:

```bash
cast send <GUARD> "transferOwnership(address)" <MULTISIG> --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
# then, from the multisig
cast send <GUARD> "acceptOwnership()"
```

Two-step on purpose: a typo in the address cannot orphan the contract.

---

## 3. Register feeds

This is the step that turns the price banner from "indicative demo marks" into a
live Chainlink read, and it is the one the demo actually depends on.

```bash
export FEED_STALENESS=93600   # 26h — sized for a 24/5 equity feed, see SECURITY.md

cast send <GUARD> "setFeed(address,address,uint64)" \
  <NVDA_TOKEN> <NVDA_FEED> $FEED_STALENESS \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.mainnet.chain.robinhood.com --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

`setFeed` validates the aggregator before storing it: it must have bytecode,
answer `decimals()`, and answer `latestRoundData()`. A wrong address is rejected
at configuration time rather than reported as STALE forever afterwards.

Three or four symbols is enough for a demo. Pick at least one with a multiplier
that is not 1.0 — that is the asset the whole opening argument rests on.

Then mirror the same map into the app so the desk reads them:

```bash
export ROBINHOOD_FEEDS='{"NVDA":{"feed":"0x…","maxStaleness":93600,"decimals":8}}'
```

and record them under `feeds.registered` in the deployment JSON so
`deploy:verify` checks them on every run.

---

## 4. Switch the desk to guarded settlement

```bash
export VITE_EXACT_TRANSFER=<EXACT_TRANSFER_ADDRESS>
npm run dev
```

The Transfer tab badge should now read **Exact settlement** instead of
**Preflight settlement**. That is not cosmetic: preflight computes the raw
amount from a multiplier read seconds earlier, while guarded re-reads it inside
the transaction. Only the second one is exact-share settlement and only the
second one should be demonstrated as such.

---

## 5. Produce the proof transaction

With a wallet holding a Stock Token, send a small share amount to a second
address of your own through the Transfer tab. Take the hash and attach it:

```bash
node scripts/record-deployment.mjs --tx 0x…
```

Then put that hash and both contract addresses at the top of `SUBMISSION.md`.
A reviewer opening the explorer is the first minute of judging; everything else
is downstream of that minute going well.

## Done when

- [ ] `npm run deploy:verify` exits zero against chain 4663
- [ ] Both explorer source tabs show verified contracts
- [ ] `"verified": true` in `deployments/chain-4663.json`, set after checking
- [ ] At least three feeds registered, one with a multiplier above 1.0
- [ ] Price banner reads Chainlink with an age, not "indicative"
- [ ] Transfer badge reads "Exact settlement"
- [ ] A guarded-route transaction hash recorded and linked
- [ ] README and SUBMISSION carry the addresses
